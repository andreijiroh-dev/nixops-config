# Contributing to the project

While this is primarily an personal project for my NixOS setup, community contributions are welcome, especially at utility tooling I wrote in the `misc` directory (e.g. [`detect-vscode-for-git`][dvscfg] and [`ssh-agent-loader`][sal]).

## Prerequisites

Other than the regular "review and agree to the [Community Code of Conduct][ccoc] and [the Linux DCO][dco]", you need the following skills:

* Hands-on experience with writing Nix configs for NixOS/home-manager (vibe coding/Gen AI is fine, just make sure to review the outputs and do test builds before submitting a patch) and shell scripting (mainly Bash)

## Sending patches
